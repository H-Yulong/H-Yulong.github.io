Project title links to its github repository page.</p>
<h3 id="Programmable-Hanafuda-2020-Now"><a href="#Programmable-Hanafuda-2020-Now" class="headerlink" title="Programmable Hanafuda (2020-Now)"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/H-Yulong/Programmable_Hanafuda">Programmable Hanafuda</a> (2020-Now)</h3><p>This is an independent game featuring programmable rules of the traditional Japanese card game, <em>Hanafuda</em>. <em>Hanafuda</em> is like the Japanese version of Poker, and players need to collect cards that match some conditions/fulfill some patterns to win.</p>
<p>These conditions are called <em>yakus</em> and they have many varients. I designed a script language that allows users to play the game with <em>self-defined yakus</em>, which no one has done before. Along with the language, I developed an interpreter for the language, a game engine, a full graphical interface for the game, and some AIs to play with. </p>
<p>For more details, check the <a href="">game’s main page</a>. </p>
<p>This is a project created entirely by myself from scrach, except the character illustrations (they were due to my friend), open source libraries and other free resources.</p>
<h3 id="AIs-for-playing-Yahtzee-2021"><a href="#AIs-for-playing-Yahtzee-2021" class="headerlink" title="AIs for playing Yahtzee (2021)"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/H-Yulong/partii_project">AIs for playing Yahtzee</a> (2021)</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a> is a commercial dice game that has been investigated deeply with the traditional search-based/heuristic approaches, but little research on playing it with machine-learning-based methods exist.</p>
<p>I built Yahtzee-playing programs with both ML and traditional approaches and compared their performance. The ML part was done using Reinforcement Learning with Neuron Networks. For details and some interesting discoveries I found, please refer to the <a href="/source/_files/dissertation.pdf">dissertation</a>.</p>
<p>This project was created for the <em>PartII Project</em> in the <em>Computer Science</em> course at the <em>University of Cambridge</em>.</p>
<h3 id="OCR-Application-for-hand-writing-notebooks-2020"><a href="#OCR-Application-for-hand-writing-notebooks-2020" class="headerlink" title="OCR Application for hand-writing notebooks (2020)"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/J-Parkinson/Group_Project_IB-Delta">OCR Application for hand-writing notebooks</a> (2020)</h3><p>This is a piece of software created for the <em>Cambridge University Museum of Zoology</em>. The museum has a huge collection of 100-years-old notebooks that records data about local butterflies. </p>
<p>These notebooks need to be transcribed on computers and it was done with hands by staffs before. I and my teamates helped to develop an application that does this job automatically with OCR.</p>
<p>My part of the job was designing and implementing a user-friendly interface for the application, since museum staffs are not very good at computers. </p>
<p>This project was created for the <em>PartIB Group Project</em> in the <em>Computer Science</em> course at the <em>University of Cambridge</em>.</p>
<h3 id="Maze-on-FPGA-2020"><a href="#Maze-on-FPGA-2020" class="headerlink" title="Maze on FPGA (2020)"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/H-Yulong/ECAD_tick_2-">Maze on FPGA</a> (2020)</h3><p>This is a game that runs on a <em>Cambridge FPGA</em>. This kind of FPGA boards are designed for teaching purpose, hence they have no OS supports and very limited memory.</p>
<p>For creating this game, I managed to implement a maze-generation algorithm, random number generators, some of GCC’s utility functions and a short animation on the FPGA with very limited resources and supports. You may see <a href="">here</a> for a video demonstration. </p>
<p>This project was created for the optional task of <em>ECAD labs</em> in the <em>Computer Science</em> course at the <em>University of Cambridge</em> originally, but later it grew way beyond the course materials. It also won the <em>Andre Fu prize</em> in 2021. </p>
