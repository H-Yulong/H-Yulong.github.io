Now I am doing my PartIII course in Computer Science and expected to graduate in July 2022 with a Masters degree.</p>
<p>I started to develop <em>Programmable Hanafuda</em>, an independent game made almost entirely by myself starting from an empty repository in the summer of 2020. The motivation of doing so was to apply what I learned from the <em>Compiler Construction</em> course, and design a simple language that is capable of describing the standard rules (<em>yakus</em>) and any varients of the traditional Japanese card game, <em>Hanafuda</em>. </p>
<p>Later, the project grew into a minimalistic game engine (without a GUI) and it had the potential of becoming an indie game. I had to put it away for a while because I need to focus on the university’s course. But, I picked it up in the summer of 2021 and completed this game as shown in the <a href="">demo page</a>.</p>
<p>I enjoy being an independent developer, especially the feeling of being the engineer, the designer, the producer and the player at the same time. As a CompSci, I have high software-engineering skills and experience; meanwhile, I have a good aesthetic taste and I am familiar with tools needed for designing the user interface, preparing GUI resources and texures, and even sound production and composing. The best thing of being a versatile is finding a place where all of my skills are incredibly useful.</p>
<p>I am also into classical and rock music. I used to appear in lots of recitals and concerts around Cambridge and London as an audience, and I was the keyboardist in the Robinson college’s rock band.  </p>
<p>Sadly, those activities had to cease last year because of the COVID-19. Luckily, I have a Roland FP-90 piano in my room that keeps me away from boredom and over-working.</p>
<p>Finally, For your interest, I was born and grew up in GuangXi province, China. I moved to Beijing later on and this is where I live now when I’m not at Cambridge.</p>
